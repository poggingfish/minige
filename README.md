# MiniGE v0.0.1

A mini game engine for point & click adventures.

# Installing

## LINUX ONLY!

Simply run
```
python3 setup.py
```
This requires your sudo password to install it to the /usr/bin directory. But after that, you can run any game by running `minige` in the directory that contains that game.

# Games

There is an example game called The Luna Parable in the `lunaparable` directory.

# Creating rooms from psd data

Enter the virtual enviornment by doing
```
source .venv/bin/python
```
and then run
```
python src/create-rooms.py
```
from the game directory.
